Hello! I'm Dolf Barr and this is the start of my 'notes' section. Here I plan to talk about frontend development. Additionally, I will explore broader topics in software engineering and computer science.

A little bit about myself:  I have over 10 years of experience as a frontend software engineer. During my career, I've worked in various settings. These range from the dynamic startups to the established tech firms. I'm also a family man, with a loving household that includes two dachshunds.

English is not my native language. So, I would appreciate any corrections or feedback to aid in improving my writing skills.

In this section, I will share personal insights and findings from my career. Currently, I am refining some open-source projects. I am also trying to enhance my knowledge of backend development and system design. Additionally, I am solving coding problems on Leetcode. I'm looking forward to sharing more with you!
